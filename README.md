This is a full guide of how I learned and deployed on aws.

AWS is Amazon's cloud service that lets you:

1. Rent servers
2. Manage domains
3. Upload files (like mp4s, jpgs, mp3s)
4. Autoscale servers
5. Create Kubernetes clusters

# **EC2 Servers**

Virtual machines (VMs) on AWS are called `EC2 servers`.

EC2 stands for "Elastic Compute Version 2."

- **Elastic**: You can increase or decrease the size of the machine.
- **Compute**: It's a machine.

---

## **Step 1 - Create a New EC2 Server**

1. Click on `Launch a new instance`.
2. Give your instance a name.
3. Select an OS (e.g., Ubuntu).
4. Choose a free instance type.
5. Create a new key pair (e.g., `youlayer.pem`).
6. Configure storage.
7. Allow traffic on HTTP/HTTPS/SSH.

---

## **Step 2 - SSH into Your Server**

Go to the folder where your `.pem` file is stored, and run this command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh -i "youlayer2.pem" ubuntu@<Your_Server_IP>
```

If you're connecting again but with a different `.pem` file, you might get an error like:

```
The authenticity of host '13.235.103.56 (13.235.103.56)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:c9diw84yQzQve33YTJMLvV7ABFZpwf6O+5te77z9Ht0.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
Host key verification failed.
```

To fix this, remove the old entry from your `known_hosts` file:

```bash
C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.ssh\\known_hosts
```

Then, run the SSH command again, adding an option to skip key verification:

```bash
ssh -i "youlayer2.pem" ubuntu@<Your_Server_IP> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

You might also get an error about file permissions:

```
WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
Permissions for 'youlayer2.pem' are too open.

Detailed Error : 
Warning: Permanently added '13.235.103.56' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions for 'youlayer2.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "youlayer2.pem": bad permissions
[ubuntu@13.235.103.5](mailto:ubuntu@13.235.103.57)6: Permission denied (publickey).
```

To fix this on Windows:

1. Right-click on the `.pem` file and select `Properties`.
2. Go to `Security > Advanced > Disable inheritance`.
3. Remove all users.
4. Add your Windows username and give it full permissions.

After this, run the SSH command again, and you should be logged in.

Then, run the SSH command again, adding an option to skip key verification:

```bash
ssh -i "youlayer2.pem" ubuntu@<Your_Server_IP>
```

Then Clone repo

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/coderomm/youlayer-tech
```

Hereâ€™s how I handled the copy-paste issue while using SSH:

1. **Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell**:
    
    To paste in the terminal:
    
    - Right-click anywhere inside the terminal window to paste.
    
    To enable keyboard shortcuts:
    
    - Right-click on the title bar of the Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
    - Select `Properties`.
    - Check the option `Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste`.
    
    Now, I can paste using `Ctrl + Shift + V` instead of just `Ctrl + V`.

## **Step 3 - Setup Node.js on Your EC2 Server**

1. Install Node.js and npm.ðŸ’¡

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04

### **Install Node.js using NodeSource PPA:**

This method installs the latest stable version of Node.js.

1. **Update your package list**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
2. **Install prerequisites**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y curl
    ```
    
3. **Install Node.js**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```
    
4. **Verify Node.js and npm installation**:
    
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
    

This will install the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Node.js along with `npm` (Node Package Manager).

1. Go to your backend directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

1. Create a `.env` file to store your environment variables (like `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`). Use the following command:

```bash
touch .env
nano .env
```

Add your variables, save, and exit the editor by:

- Pressing `Ctrl + O` to save.
- Press `Ctrl + X` to exit.

---

## **Step 4 - Run Your Backend**

After setting up the `.env` file, run your backend:

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see something like this:

```
Server is running on localhost:3000
Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas!
```

That's it! You're now running your app on an EC2 server.

## Step 5 - Step-by-Step Guide

To create a subdomain in Hostinger and point it to my EC2 instance on AWS, I followed these steps:

I needed to point my subdomain `backend.youlayer.tech` to my AWS EC2 instance while keeping the main domain (`youlayer.tech`) pointed to Vercel for the frontend. Hereâ€™s how I did it:

1. **Added A Record for the Subdomain:**
    - I went into the DNS Zone Editor in Hostinger.
    - Then, I added a new A record:
        - **Type**: A
        - **Name**: `backend` (so it points to (`backend.youlayer.tech`)
        - **Target**: I used my EC2 IP (`13.235.103.57`).
        - **TTL**: I left it at 14400 (or you can use 3600 for faster propagation).
    - This didnâ€™t interfere with my existing A record for `youlayer.tech`, which points to Vercel.
2. **Set Up Security Group in AWS:**
    - I made sure the security group for my EC2 instance allowed HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
3. **DNS Propagation:**
    - I waited for DNS propagation (it can take a few minutes to hours). I used `whatsmydns.net` to check the status of `backend.youlayer.tech`.
4. **Accessed the Subdomain:**
    - Once the DNS changes propagated, I was able to access my backend via `backend.youlayer.tech`.

This way, my frontend stays on Vercel and my backend runs on the EC2 instance.

## Step 6 - Nginx

### **Hereâ€™s how I handled installing `pm2` globally:**

I use `pm2` to keep my Node.js app running continuously, even after crashes or reboots. It also helps with monitoring, log management, and scaling for better performance.

Since I was installing `pm2` globally and it required writing to a protected system directory, I needed to use elevated permissions. So, I ran the command with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

This gave the necessary permissions to install `pm2` globally without any issues.

## **Step 7 - What is a reverse proxy?**

### **Create reverse proxy**

```jsx
sudo rm sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

```jsx
events {
    # Event directives...
}

http {
	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name backend.youlayer.tech;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}
}
```

### **How to edit/save a file through Ubuntu Terminal**

> Press Esc and then type below respectively
> 
> 
> ```
> :wq //save and exit
> :q! //exit without saving
> ```
> 
1. sudo nano path_to_file/file_name

### **Start the Backend server**

```jsx
node index.js
```
